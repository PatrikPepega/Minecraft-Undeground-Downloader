# Minecraft Undeground Downloader :fire:
YOUR ultimate garage for Minecraft clients, mods and tools. The first open-source downloader in the universe.
### What is M.U.D?
Minecraft Underground Downloader Rewritten (shortly M.U.D) is a program that works like a downloader but better. M.U.D features a full Windows PC program with everything that normal program has. You can use it to download your favourite Minecraft clients, mods and tools. What tools you may ask? M.U.D includes tools that can help you create you own client, inspect existing clients, etc. It also includes pictures and FAQ how to install selected clients. There are some websites and GitHub repositories that are created for people to download Minecraft clients such as Rise, Tenacity, etc.. but there is no app that you could have on your PC locally.
### Why rewritten?
M.U.D started as fan project in 2022. It was poorly made and barely worked. It was created in python, and then converted to .EXE, which is not the best way of making PC apps. One day, after year of M.U.D creation (which was abandoned), i got an idea, to create an actual working version that would include everything a pro player needs on one place. So, i started developing a new version from scratch in C#. If you want, you can still download the old version from releases section.
